# WhatsApp Attendance Notifier 📱📊

A Python-based automation tool to notify parents via **WhatsApp** when a student is marked **Absent** or **Left Early** in the attendance sheet. The messages are sent using **Selenium WebDriver** and **WhatsApp Web**.

---

## ✨ Features

- Reads attendance from an Excel file (`.xlsx`)
- Sends WhatsApp messages automatically to parent numbers
- GUI-based interface using Tkinter
- Free (no paid API needed like Twilio)
- Supports "Absent" and "Left" alerts

---

## 📁 Excel Format

Your attendance Excel file should have the following columns:

| Name       | Status   | Parent Number     |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| John Doe   | Present  | +91XXXXXXXXXX     |
| Jane Smith | Absent   | +91YYYYYYYYYY     |
| Max Lee    | Left     | +91ZZZZZZZZZZ     |

✅ Use `Absent` or `Left` (case-insensitive) to trigger a message.

---

## 💬 Message Templates

- **Absent**:
```

Dear Parent, your child {Name} was marked absent today. Please ensure regular attendance.

```

- **Left**:
```

Dear Parent, your child {Name} has left school early today. Please confirm the reason.
